Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Call echo service immediately after socket reconnect

Commit 4fcd1813e640 ("Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect
long after socket reconnect") changes the behaviour of the SMB2 echo
service and causes it to renegotiate after a socket reconnect. However
under default settings, the echo service could take up to 120 seconds to
be scheduled.

The patch forces the echo service to be called immediately resulting a
negotiate call being made immediately on reconnect.
